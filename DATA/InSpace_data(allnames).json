Framed by her travels in Iceland, these essays posit inbetweenness as the most vital position from which to perceive culture as a whole, and a fluidity in national identity as the best model for writing and thinking about art and culture. \n\nBluets is a book by American author Maggie Nelson, published by Wave Books in 2009. The work hybridizes several prose and poetry styles as it documents Nelson's multifaceted experience with the color blue, and is often referred to as lyric essay or prose poetry. It was written between 2003 and 2006.",

Art of Projection serves as a timely reconsideration of media art's history.",

During that time, the court of law has come to rely on a variety of new representational modes and technologies. The law is increasingly staged on a screen and the photographs, video documents and audio recordings used as evidence are not entirely distinct from their correlates in contemporary art, cinema and mass media. What questions of representation, judgment and justice cross the border between art and the law? Through the contribution of internationally renowned artists and scholars, this anthology explores how the aesthetics of new media technology and its spatial implementations affect the judicial system in relation to fundamental concepts such as truth and representation.",

This book takes the riot, and Douglas's work, as points of departure to discuss the legacy and implications of this tumultuous time, not only for Vancouver but for all urban centres where dissent and conflict based on class, lifestyle, or other issues arise, and where the role of authorities is contested in the form of public demonstration.",

Working with Szeemann’s book as case study, With A Bao A Qu reflects on the form and structure of the artist’s book. By stylistically adopting a subjective literary voice, drawn, at least partially, from Jorge Luis Borges’s Book of Imaginary Beings (published in English in 1969), Fusco’s book shifts its focus away from the reading of art’s conceptual properties to that of its physical, material embodiment.",

With examples of the elaborate dams built by beavers or the lavishly decorated bowers of bowerbirds, Gigliotti provides a new perspective on animals as agents in their own lives, as valuable contributors to their world and ours, and as guides in understanding how creativity may contribute to conserving the natural world. Presenting a powerful argument for the importance of recognizing animals as individuals and as creators of a healthy, biodiverse world, this book offers insights into both the established and emerging questions about the creativity of animals.",

In Arthur Erickson’s estimation: “Not only is he Saskatchewan’s finest architect ever, but Clifford Wiens’ work is of international importance.”\n\nNow based in Vancouver after a 30 year-long nationally acclaimed design career in Regina, Wiens’ projects range from a handbuilt conical studio for sculptor John Nugent, to the primal Silton Chapel, a powerful and wall-less pavilion set into the banks of the Qu’Appelle Valley. Telling Details includes photographs of ten major Wiens designs, plus sketches, working drawings, and beautifully-detailed architectural models, some make by the 83 year-old architect expressly for this exhibition, showing for the last time here after a national tour. Emphasizing the human side of architecture, the exhibition also includes video footage of the architect in which he returns to view and talk about his buildings, some of which he has not seen for decades. All of these elements within the Telling Details exhibition work together to provide insight into the ideas of Wiens, one of Canada’s leading Modern Architects and close associate of the Regina Five abstract painters.",

References to popular culture and personal history are abstracted and narratives emptied to construct situations where possibilities are opened up — for the artists themselves and for others.\n\nIn Strippers Cullinan + Richards negotiate a site between abstraction and figuration. Paintings based on Russ Meyer’s cult film Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) mark out possible roles for the artworks and establish scenarios in an attempt to disturb hierarchies of what artwork is supposed to be. The installation features text and paintings presented on paneled walls that function as physical dividers and mounts for the paintings as well as being sculptures in their own right. In this system, the paintings are supported and subtly undermined by their method of presentation. Further elements in the show include water fountains and sculptures that play with notions of figuration and monumentality.",

Working with a variety of media, these artists use music, the urban soundscape, and the play between the presence and absence of sound as their subject matter.\n\nIn Part 1 of the exhibition Scottish artist Dave Allen will present two works, For the Dogs, based onan Erik Satie composition and Everything Starts on A, Everything Ends on B, a sketch for a turntable/live concert composition. As well, Allen will give a live performance during the opening reception. Berlin-based Swedish artist Annika Eriksson’s video projection The Soundtrack depicts a lone musician on a busy city street. Though alone at his drum kit he is accompanied by the sounds of the urban environment around him. The urban soundscape is also the subject of Irish artist Dennis McNulty’s work in which he creates improvised site-specific soundtracks for locations within the built environment. For The Sound I’m Looking For, McNulty has created a new work, one second of a possible future/monospan twin ride and will carry out a number of live performances in public spaces (please see www.sndmsc.com for further details).\n\nA Brief Account of the History of Recorded Music, Re-interpreted (Au Clair de la lune), a new silent video piece by Vancouver artist Ian Skedd is based on the artist’s research into the phonautogram, a 19th century invention designed to record sound visually rather than aurally. In New York artist Matthew Buckingham’s audio work Infinite Tuning we hear an orchestra alternately warm up and tune but never actually play a piece of music thus subverting expectations and our feelings of anticipation.",

    "summary": "The Sound I’m Looking For, Part 2, an exhibition of sound-based work by Canadian and international artists curated by Cate Rimmer. The second part of this two-part exhibition explores auditory experience, our relationship to music and the ways that sound functions socially and ideologically.\n\nScottish artist and musician Luke Fowler’s documentary film Pilgrimage From Scattered Points looks at composer Cornelius Cardew and The Scratch Orchestra, formed in the late sixties. The Scratch Orchestra performed experimental compositions until ideological rifts brought about its demise in the early seventies. Fowler blends archival and contemporary footage while also playing with our ideas of the documentary format. While Fowler’s film works have been shown in Europe and the United States this is the first time his work will be shown in Canada.\n\nIn her site-specific installation work for the exhibition Vancouver-based Holly Ward incorporates a poem about entropy and progress by the visionary architect R. Buckminster Fuller. Ward recorded the reading in a geodesic dome in Germany built by the US as a listening station to monitor the former East German Republic, a function at odds with Fuller’s idealistic beliefs. Ward’s work has been shown internationally and locally including Idyll: 3 Exhibitions at the Morris and Helen Belkin Gallery earlier this year.\n\nBerlin-based Ceal Floyer creates a sensory experience in her sound installation Goldberg Variation. Taking Bach’s initial aria as her starting point, Floyer simultaneously overlays multiple versions which break down into a cacophony that disorders the reasoned structure of Bach’s composition. Floyer is a renowned artist whose work has been included in exhibitions throughout the world including a major solo exhibition currently at the Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Donna Regina in Naples, Italy.\n\nToronto artist, writer and composer Brian Joseph Davis’ work Original Soundtrack uses musical cues from menus of commercially available DVD’s in order to create a new score that manipulates, loops and combines his chosen source material. Documentation of a recent performance of the work along with Davis’ graphic score for the piece will be displayed in the exhibition. Davis has created a number of sound-based works which he refers to as “re-purposed” popular music.\n\nFor his work in the exhibition, Vancouver-based artist, writer, and musician Brady Cranfield examines a major divide in rock history. He will stage a performance in the ECU Theatre where high-school debate teams will tackle the question “Who’s better, The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?” In the gallery, Cranfield will show a new work titled The White Album and Sticky Fingers which is comprised of two silent, looping videos that picture the artist listening to vinyl copies of the classic records.",

The sense of disuse and non-productivity associated with vacant lots is transformed through this process of relocation. What was once identified as a void within the landscape of urban development is ascribed with new use value. As Koh says, “Although withdrawn from ‘constructive’ use, the space is far from empty, but rather full of richly non-productive time and process.”",

    "summary": "Positioning the New is a comprehensive survey of the work of Canadian photographer Selwyn Pullan. In a career spanning over fifty years, Pullan played a critical role in advancing West Coast modern architecture. He documented residences and institutional projects for British Columbia’s leading architects in an intense and innovative period in the three decades following World War Two.\n\nPullan studied photography at the Los Angeles Art Centre (now the Art Center College of Design), graduating in 1950. Architectural photography, then a relatively new profession, had emerged in parallel to modernism and the advances in architecture in North America during the late 1930’s, and Pullan found his niche in this genre. Pullan’s photographs promoted the new style to a populace eager to embrace a modern way of living. His images were frequently included in photo essays in major design and architectural periodicals.\n\nPullan was sought out specifically for his inventive compositions and ability to contextualize new buildings. Pullan documented the work of architects such as Ron Thom, Fred Hollingsworth, Arthur Erickson and Barry Downs, among numerous others. Although primarily known for his architectural photography, Pullan also produced a significant body of work depicting Vancouver’s urban landscape, portraiture industry, fashion and design.",

    "summary": "A departure from the photographic work Bubaš is best known for, this exhibition presents a series of soft pastel portraits based on the cast of the hit MTV reality show The Hills. The female-centric drama focuses on the relationships between a group of friends living in Hollywood, the camera catching their conflicts and moments of vulnerability in a high production reality show format.\n\nThe arguments and break-ups of the cast have been viewed by millions. In her series of portraits Bubaš captures these moments of gasps, tears, and drawn-out stares that fans of the show are witness to. Encapsulating the universal appeal of reality television, Bubaš evokes these familiar moments; we all share Lauren’s frustration as she fights with Audrina and bursts into tears, her watery black mascara rolling down her cheeks. We experience aggravation over how Spencer treats Heidi and her frustrating complacency.  We are there when Stephanie is fired from her job and we experience dating someone that is unfaithful (Justin Bobby). These drawings conjure visions of our collective social experience.\n\nIn using soft chalk pastel as a medium Bubaš evokes the work of artists such as Paul César Helleu, famous for his portraits of fashionable society women in the Edwardian era, as well as Toulouse-Lautrec’s studies of Parisian performers. Though informal in nature Toulouse-Lautrec’s portraits, like those of Bubaš, depict individuals used to living their lives in the public eye.",

Culturally and economically diverse communities are separated by the dividing walls of urban development such as those formed by the freeways and roadways of urban sprawl. In Ochoa's words, \"Walls may mean protection, as in a retaining wall. But they also indicate borders, keeping something out of the way\".\n\nThe work on exhibition at the Charles H. Scott is based on a public intervention that Ochoa produced in 2006 with funding by Creative Capital Foundation where he attached vinyl wallpaper to the concrete barrier wall on Interstate 10, a major arterial route running through Los Angeles. The wallpaper depicted the kind of greenery beyond the barrier, thereby giving the appearance that a portion of the wall had been extracted and the barrier between communities breached. A remnant of the original wallpaper and a series of related lenticular photo works are presented in the exhibition along with a series of propositional drawings.",

Canada is no longer simply seen as a supplier of raw materials. Instead, Canadian designers have been recognized internationally for their inventive work, turning those raw materials into products that are marketed around the world.\n\nWhile Canadian designers engage in design on an international level, connected to the global economy of the 21st century, they also respond to aesthetic, cultural, and economic considerations that are uniquely Canadian. The Canadian environment has been the locus of pioneering designs for decades. With rugged landscapes, vast distances, and harsh winters, our surroundings have offered challenges and enticements for designers and have inspired the development of products that enable individuals to pursue activities in the Canadian landscape. Many products, such as kayaks and snowshoes, have evolved from their traditional designs into modern pieces through the use of high tech materials, advanced manufacturing processes, and new design strategies.\n\nThe idea of ‘High Performance’ is a unifying theme in the exhibition. All well-designed objects are meant to perform, yet because of their ultimate use some must function at an extraordinary level. Whether for extreme sports and conditions, for rigorous outdoor activity, or for recreational use, Canadian designers have excelled at producing innovative products in this field.\n\nThe exhibition is curated by Greg Bellerby and designed by Campos Leckie and Oliver Neumann in collaboration with the University of British Columbia School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture and the University of Toronto Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design.",

Thomas Glassford’s Stela 1K, is a tower made up of 850 broomsticks salvaged from the streets of Mexico City, their surfaces imbued with a residue of human touch and labour. Gabriel de la Mora’s minimalist drawings and constructions use human hair to subtly reference the body and identity.

Miscreants and Reprobates is the second exhibition of MacLeod’s work at the Charles H. Scott Gallery. Her A Brief Overview of Personology was shown at the gallery in 2000.\n\nWilliam Hogarth (1697-1764) was highly successful during his lifetime and his prints continue to be popular for their witty depictions of all levels of English society during that colourful era.

Ader would have known of Donald Crowhurst, an English yachtsman who in 1968 also went missing on a solo voyage (a copy of a book about Crowhurst was found in Ader’s possessions). The story of both men is conflated in a work by the Australian collective Slave Pianos (Danius Kesminus, Michael Stevenson, Neil Kelly, Rohan Drape). The Strange Voyage of Bas Jan Ader is a radio play, musical score and collection of documents that are drawn from an interview with Ader’s widow and the ramblings of Crowhurst.\n\nTwo artists in the exhibition take Ernest Shackleton’s doomed expedition to the Antarctic as their subject. Los Angeles-based Karl Haendel has produced a striking installation of drawings taken from photographs of the expedition while New York artist Nina Katchadourian’s Endurance is a video projection in which original film footage of Shackleton’s ship breaking up in the ice is projected on her tooth. A historic event of great notoriety is also the subject of New York-based Matthew Benedict Titanic Breakfast Sampler.\n\nIn dialogue with the works of contemporary art will be a selection of historical materials documenting ill-fated voyages from coastal British Columbia. Of particular note is a poignant artefact from the 1875 wreck of the Pacific on loan from the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The Maritime Museum will be collaborating with the Charles H.

    "summary": "A solo exhibition by Toronto artist Michelle Gay. Gay investigates relationships of language, the body and memory and the way in which they are mediated through machine technologies via a multi-disciplinary practice that includes computer projections, animations and drawing.\n\nPoemitron is a software program Gay developed in collaboration with her brother, particle physicist Colin Gay. The program randomly selects a word in a text and replaces it with a synonym from the program’s database. This process takes place in real time. Gay’s work spampoet is a computer projection in which the artist collected spam, texts from junk email, and processed them using the Poemitron software. This creates a text that is continuously altering and results in surprising combinations of words, often creating unexpected poetic phrases.\n\nstretchpoem is a projection that also uses custom programming. Here Gay takes promises made by Barack Obama and John McCain during the last US presidential race as her subject. This work includes a pressure pad that allows the viewer to manipulate the text. By applying pressure with the hand the projected text enlarges and appears to move towards the viewer, immersing them in the rhetoric of political slogans. When the pressure is released the words retreat into the projection.\n\nOther works in the exhibition also utilize devices that the viewer can access to activate and engage with the work. Her most recent work Retrieval Pictures, uses a touch tablet that when stroked reveals images of newspaper articles of past events. Articles concerning war, disaster and politics are revealed then fade when the viewer stops touching the device. The work is a poignant statement about the workings of memory and the act of remembering and forgetting. Gay uses technology in a complex and critical manner to engage with language, poetics and politics.",

    "summary": "Golkar’s site-specific installation is made up of two major components that work together to investigate complex relationships between perception, space, architecture and culture.\n\nUsing Persian carpets as a foundation, Golkar literally “draws up” design elements from the intricate patterns and transforms them into three-dimensional scale models that resemble architectural mega-towers. Buildings recently constructed in the Middle East, and elsewhere, such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai (the world’s tallest building) may come to mind. These architectural miniatures play off the representations of space found in the traditional iconography of the carpets, which would reference specific geographies in their patterning.\n\nGolkar has altered the gallery by building walls that divide the space into patterns based on those of the Persian carpet. The miniature structures are expanded so that the viewer may walk within them. The lines between past and future, interior and exterior, architecture and object blur as scale shifts and two-dimensional patterns translate into three-dimensional objects while engaging with the evolving representation of a culture through ideas of the historical carpet and the futuristic city.",

    "summary": "The exhibition is the third in a multi-part series about the sea. While the first two exhibitions focused on lighthouses and ill-fated voyages, this instalment is about what is below the water’s surface. \n\nIrish artist Dorothy Cross has a strong affinity for the sea and its creatures. Her video Jellyfish Lake, depicts a woman floating amid the millions of ghostly jellyfish that migrate daily across a marine lake in Palau. Like Cross, David Zink Yi, a Peruvian-born artist, has made a number of works about sea creatures specifically cephalopods such as Giant Squid or the Octopus sculpture which is included in The Voyage. On the opposite end of the scale are the microscopic organisms that are studied by The Laboratory of Marine Obscuriosity and Spectaculars – the Marine Zoology and Botany lab headed by Brian Leander at the University of British Columbia. A series of images captured through electron microscopy will be exhibited including a newly discovered organism found in Vancouver’s English Bay.\n\nSince 2010, Fiona Bowie has been documenting the underwater life of Vancouver’s False Creek through her project Surface. The Voyage will include a version of this and play off the Charles H. Scott’s close proximity to the subaquatic environ represented in Bowie’s work. Terry Kerby is Chief Submersible Pilot for the Hawai‘i Undersea Research Labs manned submersible program. In recent years he has been painting the scenes he encounters during his deep-sea dives, a selection of which will be in the exhibition. Ama, the Japanese women that have free-dived for centuries in search of abalone and seaweed are the subject of Swedish filmmaker Sonia Hedstrand’s video installation Ama-san. A way of life dying out in large part due to pollution and overfishing, Hedstrand’s work documents three generations of women from the same family who are some of the last to make a living as Ama.\n\nTroy Morgan is an artist and animator working in Los Angeles. He has created a body of work entitled Beneath the Sea about the obsession to collect, contain and possess underwater life forms. A series of his watercolours and sculptures will be presented in The Voyage. A desire to fully engage the subaquatic world he encountered drove Zarh Pritchard (1866 – 1956) to develop methods that would allow him to paint underwater rather than from memory. Wearing a diving helmet Pritchard would sit at his easel and depict scenes from the coast of Scotland to Tahiti. Three of these paintings will be part of the exhibition.",

The internet has become the people’s cyber discipline committee in China because it encourages members of socially excluded communities to use their virtual voices. Dissidence and public critique has become more covert pushing citizens to become netizens expressing their opinions via the internet.\n\nSocial media such as Weibo, Facebook and personal Blogs have given a new voice to the contemporary art scene in China. The exhibition explores how meaning is communicated through social media today, from different perspectives and approaches. Lu Yang examines communication technology and the growth of artificial intelligence. Zhang Lehua’s Facebook is a video narrated by an animated portal of Friedrich Engles instructing students on how to create a flipbook of faces with their classmate. The end result is a government approved and endorsed “Facebook”. Ge Fei and Lin Zhen commissioned two Beijing bands to compose music which they make it available to visitors via an online music sharing application. Forget Art Collective established a series of programs to challenge both social and spatial constructions in China. The Youth Apartment Exchange Program (YAEP), encourages the temporary swapping of residences. Remon Wang has 100,000 followers on his Weibo account where he posts comic illustrations commenting on national and local politics. Regulators have closed his Weibo account more than one hundred times, but have not stopped him from re-inventing new ways to get his message across.",

The works in this room represent a culmination of those summers in Vancouver, and of exchanges spoken from diverse locations--international, local, urban, rural and remote during the intermediate months.\n\nThe artists are dispersed by geography, as much as their works are separated by mode of representation, personal history, theory, and language.\n\nThe artists are connected by Vancouver, by the shared experience of the MAA program, and by the influences they have had on one another. You are invited to consider this process and the resulting works here as the final products of a momentary, conclusive heterotopia.",

    "summary": "Marianna Schmidt was born in Hungary in 1918 and immigrated to Canada in 1952, first settling in Edmonton where she studied medical technology. In 1960, at the age of forty-two, Schmidt moved to Vancouver, enrolled at the Vancouver School of Art and supported herself by working nights at Vancouver General Hospital. At art school she focused on printmaking with instructor Orville Fisher and was greatly influenced by the artist and instructor Jack Shadbolt. Her student work reflects her skill at drawing the figure and the impact of the expressive styles of Goya and Picasso.\n\nSoon after graduating in 1964 her prints were recognized for their bold expressive qualities that presented figures in invented landscapes reminiscent of Bosch and Dubuffet. Throughout her career Schmidt engaged with international art movements. In the late 1960s and 1970s she produced a series of silkscreen prints informed by Pop Art and Hard-edge abstraction. The 1980s saw a return of expressionist figurative work, for which Schmidt had a lasting affinity. She especially admired the work of a number of German Neo-expressionist artists and during this time produced a large number of mixed media works on paper exploring the human condition through figuration.\n\nSchmidt was never content to focus on one mode of expression and over the span of her forty-year career she made prints, drawings, painting, collages and photographs. What is consistent is her exploration of the figure and its power to represent emotional and psychological states. She not only drew from local and distant artists and movements she felt connected to, she drew from her personal experience instilling her work with poignancy.\n\nMarianna Schmidt passed away in 2005 at the age of 87. She generously left her estate to Emily Carr University and this substantial gift includes work from her early student drawings and prints to her last collages produced in 2002. The exhibition reflects the wide range of works produced by this prolific and exceptional artist.",

Part IV looks at the business and politics of shipping and features the work of three internationally renowned artists – Stan Douglas, Uriel Orlow and Allan Sekula.\n\nIn Journey into Fear, Stan Douglas conflates Herman Melville’s The Confidence Man with two film versions of Eric Ambler's espionage novel Journey Into Fear. Each film version one from 1942, the other from 1975, is adapted to suit the political intrigues of their day. Douglas’ version is open ended and fraught with uncertainty which is heightened through his use of looping and repetition.\n\nIn 1967, fourteen cargo vessels were caught in the Suez Canal at the outbreak of the Six Day War and were unable to leave until the canal was re-opened eight years later. During that time the multi-national crews that were required to stay with the ships formed a community and their story is the subject of Swiss artist Uriel Orlow’s project The Short and Long of It.\n\nAllan Sekula is one of the leading contemporary artists working with the subject of shipping and late capitalism. From his seminal work Fish Story to his latest film The Forgotten Space, made with Noel Burch, Sekula has investigated the impact of globalization on the workers that make a living from the sea and on the sea itself. For the exhibition, Sekula will present The Forgotten Space along with a version of his large project Ship of Fools.",

He has rendered drawings on the monumental scale of history painting as in The Brides, an eight foot by eight foot drawing on canvas, while the monochromatic greys of his recent paintings mimic the tonality of drawing. The new paintings, watercolours and drawings on exhibition at the Charles H. Scott Gallery are a continuation of Wedman's grey monochromatic series, which he began in 2007. Like earlier work in the series they depict images of spectacle, including flying saucers and underwater volcanoes, although Wedman denies the potential for extravagance these kinds of images inherently contain by obfuscating the image and emptying them of colour.\n\nFor Wedman, rendering the work in grey tones \"draws your attention away from subject matter and turns it to a consideration of a flat picture plane, and the consideration of subjecthood and why the subject is interesting. It transforms the subject, sometimes in ways that are unexpected.\" An example of this is a series of twelve watercolours of newspaper pages where the content is made indistinguishable with only the familiar structural form remaining recognizable. They play with notions of the familiar, and he as he puts it, \"you take something from one place and open up its potential meaning. It's not really anything remarkable.",

The Mediterranean Sea plays a significant role in the artist's work as the site of historical, cultural and contemporary movement between North Africa and Europe. The exhibition at the Charles H. Scott Gallery will consist of two recent multi-disciplinary projects – Transmettre en abyme, 2012 and Lighthouse in the Sea of Time, 2011.\n\nIn Lighthouse in the Sea of Time, Sedira turns her attention to lighthouses on the Algerian coastline. Through her exploration of these impressive structures and the objects and archival materials they contain, the artist reveals vestiges of colonial history. She also features interviews with contemporary lighthouse keepers telling their stories and providing insight into their lives on the edge of the sea. In Transmettre en abyme, the artist investigates an immense photographic archive documenting ships arriving and departing from the port of Marseille over a period of sixty years taken by Marcel Baudelaire, a \"shipspotter\" extraordinaire. The amassed images the archive contains speak of the endless flow of goods and human cargo transported by the vessels Baudelaire depicts.",

    "summary": "The sculpture, photography and video works in the exhibition explore cosmology, quantum physics and universal constants. Linked by the physical properties of light and the paradigm-shifting potential of the ground glass lens, each work expands the notion of our collective journey through time and space.\n\nThe speed of light, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics. In his book, The Universe Within, Theoretical Physicist Neil Turok refers to the experiments of Max Planck when he writes, “The strange story of the Quantum begins with the humble electric light bulb.” Planck hypothesized the existence of a constant, now known as Planck’s constant, which links a wave or particle’s frequency with its total energy – a theory that forms the basis of quantum physics.  In his ongoing series of short videos Heat=Light=Heat, Scott Massey makes visual the relationship between the common tungsten light bulb and quantum physics through simple actions performed during a single, unedited take.\n\nThe artist’s Empty Moon (for Yves Klein) merges two iconic photographs, Yves Klein’s Le Saut dans le Vide (Leap into the Void) from 1960 which depicts the artist frozen in flight and Harold Edgerton’s stroboscopic image Milk Crown from 1938 capturing a milk drop in a split-second of motion. The stoppage of time in both images creates an anxious desire to see what comes next and in his sculptural installation Empty Moon (for Yves Klein) Massey starts the clock again.\n\nIn La Lune Perdue, Scott Massey looks to the beginning of photography and the history changing Daguerreotype. One of Louis Daugerre’s earliest images, a picture of the moon, was the first astronomical photograph ever made. It was later destroyed in a fire and lost forever. Massey recreates Daguerre’s photograph through a combination of antique and updated technologies. The relationship between photography and celestial bodies continues in Transit (viewed through unexposed processed transparency film), a large photograph the artist made during the June 5th 2012 transit of the planet Venus across the face of the sun taken in the desert outside of Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nUntitled (An object kindly enclyning) is a video of a large magnifying lens spinning on an illuminated glass surface. The way in which it moves in an unexpected and endless loop plays with perception and logic. In addition to addressing the physics of the spinning lens, Massey is also interested in the lens itself and the shift from undisputed belief to scientific observation of the heavens that occurred through the advent of the ground glass lens.\n\nThe magnifying lens takes centre stage in Cloud Making (viewed under the principle of least time, or constructive interference), a sculpture incorporating an elaborate system of magnifying lenses. A droplet of water hits a heated dish above a Bunsen burner and becomes a cloud of steam. The light from this action is inverted by multiple lenses making the cloud appear to fall rather than rise as logic would dictate it should.",

Photography has continued to play and important role in promoting and popularizing architecture especially in the post-war period. Photographers were able to capture the innovations of modernist design such as post and beam construction that allowed for large open interior spaces, the emphasis on the flow between indoor and outdoor spaces and the relation of the modern house to its site.\n\nBeginning in the nineteen fifties, magazines like Western Homes and Living, commissioned photographers Graham Warrington, Selwyn Pullan and John Fulker to document the houses featured in the magazine. The photographs and accompanying texts allowed the average person to vicariously inhabit the spaces of these private residences and introduced them to the idea of modern living. Photographers not only popularized the new style, they also contributed to the success of local architects and helped West Coast residential architecture become internationally recognized.\n\nThe exhibition Photography and the West Coast Modern House, brings together a selection of mid-century works by Graham Warrington, Selwyn Pullan and John Fulker with works by contemporary photographers Simon Scott, Martin Tessler and Krista Janhke who continue in the tradition of Vancouver architectural photography. The exhibition also includes works by Jim Breukelman and Arni Haraldsson both of whom have produced photographic series' that explore a more intimate view of the modern house . In the late 1980's Breukelman produced a series of photographs of post-war Vancouver bungalows entitled Hot Properties. While Haraldsson photographed three important modern houses inhabited by Vancouver artists BC Binning, Jack Shadbolt and Gordon Smith.",

    "summary": "The Voyage, or Three Years at Sea Part VI is the final chapter in an exhibition series that explores our relationship to the sea. In Part VI, we explore sea lore—pirates, sea monsters, lost islands, lost souls—the stuff of legends and tales that have ignited imaginations for centuries and are at the heart of some of the world’s great literature from Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick to Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island. As with the previous iterations in the Voyage series, Part VI brings together the work of local and international contemporary artists with archival materials that form linkages with the rich depths of maritime history.\n\nLos Angeles-based artist Glenn Kaino has produced a body of work based on the Turkish pirate and cartographer, Piri Reis, who during the first part of the sixteenth century created detailed maps and charts, including some of the earliest of the Americas. These maps began as abstract drawings from Piri’s early days as a pirate. Kaino’s large sculptural work A Plank for Every Pirate (2012) is also included in the exhibition. Bristling with planks (the stuff of every pirate story), painted white and suspended in midair, Kaino’s ship is a ghostly spectre of revolutionary possibility.\n\nIn his work titled, A preliminary sketch for the reappearance of HyBrazil (2007–2009), Irish artist Sean Lynch reconsiders the legend of an island that for centuries was thought to have existed off the coast of Ireland. HyBrazil first appeared on charts by Italian cartographer Angelino Dulcert in the fourteenth century and it remained on maps for over five hundred years. For his project, Lynch positioned a camera overlooking the Atlantic facing toward the charted location of the mythical island and at sunset each evening took photographs when light and shadow suggested a mirage, or potential presence of a land mass.\n\nDuke Riley is an artist based in New York. His varied practice includes large-scale public projects, performative interventions, drawings, mosaics and tattooing; all of which engage with maritime history and the tensions between authority and those on the periphery. Combining populist myths and reinvented historical obscurities, Riley “profile[s] the space where water meets land, traditionally marking the periphery of urban society, what lies beyond rigid moral constructs, a sense of danger and possibility.”\n\nChapter seven of Bram Stoker’s Dracula tells the story of the voyage of the Demeter, the ship that unbeknownst to the captain and crew is transporting the ‘undead’ in their cargo. Told through the log entries of the captain, an overwhelming sense of foreboding grows as an eerie presence hangs over the ship and one by one the crew disappears. The tale expresses the superstitions and fears of mariners isolated and vulnerable on vast expanses of the open ocean. It also shares a kinship with the many historical accounts of mysterious and unexplained disappearances at sea. For The Voyage, or Three Years at Sea Part VI, Vancouver artist Angus Ferguson has produced a series of paintings based on the doomed passage of the Demeter.\n\nA sense of eerie unease is also present in Lowlands (2010), a sound work by Scottish artist Susan Philipsz, for which she won the Turner Prize in 2010. In this work, the artist sings three slightly different versions of a sixteenth-century Scottish ballad titled Lowlands Away; a haunting lament about a man drowned at sea who returns to his lover to tell her of his death. The work speaks to themes of longing and escapism often associated with a life at sea and to the ever present spectre of loss hanging over loved ones left on shore.\n\nThere are countless legends throughout the seafaring world of sea monsters and sea creatures that are both animal and human in form. In the British Isles these take the form of selkies or finfolk able to transform from seal to human and back again. In his video work, Finfolk (2003), British artist Marcus Coates casts himself in the role of one such creature emerging from an icy North Sea to experience a brief visit on land. As in his other works such as Journey to the Lower World (2004), Coates collapses the distinctions between animal and human, myth and the banal everyday.\n\nLike Coates, Beau Dick, a Kwakwaka’wakw artist from Alert Bay, has depicted sea creatures that are in human form. Among the many sea-related stories of the coastal First Nations peoples is that of Pookmis, the malevolent spirit of a drowned whaler, who brings danger to seafarers and collects their souls for Kumugwe, the lord of the undersea. In Dick’s powerful masks, Pookmis is ghostly white with crazed eyes and flotsam caught in his hair. Dick’s work speaks of a strong, enduring connection to the sea shared by people throughout the world that make a living either on or at the edge of the sea.",

    "summary": "An exhibition featuring two new film works by Canadian-born, UK-based artist Mark Lewis. These works, Brown’s Point and City Road, March 24, 2012, like Lewis’ other films currently being shown at the Vancouver Art Gallery’s Offsite, speak to the artist’s interest in the medium of film and in the way filmic devices are employed in cinematic language. However, unlike the series at Offsite, the films at the Charles H. Scott Gallery are more photographic having been composed and shot from a fixed point. In talking about his work, Lewis has stated that he is “interested in how the origins of film are, in some respects, in the picture that starts to transform. I try to understand the extent to which one can strip film down to be an experience of depiction, of showing something.”\n\nSince the mid-nineties Lewis has been experimenting with the medium of film. It was an obvious progression from his earlier photographic works that were heavily influenced by film theory especially the work of Victor Burgin and feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey.  In recent years Lewis has been increasingly engaged in a process of paring down the elements of a film to the bare minimum. At the same time he fosters the viewer’s ability to animate narrative possibilities, they anticipate potential fictive scenarios based on their own understanding of cinema.",

Thib’s work borrows decorative patterns from textiles and domestic surfaces, reconstitutes them through operations of cutting and piling, and reinvents them with magnification, repetition and excision. In doing so, the artist translates historical designs into contemporary industrial materials and extends them into three-dimensional, sculptural forms.\n\nCurator Tila Kellman sees Thib’s manipulation of ornament as a critique of Modernism. Kellman writes: “In her practice, using advanced design and fabricating techniques and contemporary industrial materials, Jeannie Thib offers a critique of the modernist, rectilinear, standardized space and design that prizes efficiency. She asks, what if our built environment were based on ornamental floral patterns?”",

    "summary": "An exhibition of photographs by Canadian poet Peter Culley, who lives and works in a district on the periphery of Nanaimo, British Columbia known as Area A. Within Area A’s boundaries are suburbs, reserves, forests, farms, rivers, railroad tracks, used car lots, grow-ops, abandoned roads, a pulp mill, landfills, beaver ponds and trailer parks. Walking every day with his dog and a waterproof point and shoot camera, Culley records these interstitial spaces in images of a passionate and sometimes lurid intensity that owe as much to the science fictions of J.G. Ballard, Robert Smithson and Andrei Tarkovsky as the Canadian landscape tradition, in which the apocalypse is as much an unseen presence as the whine of trucks on the Island Highway.\n\nThe vast accumulation of photographs documenting Culley’s walks have been compiled and displayed in the form of a blog Mosses from an Old Manse but have not been presented within an exhibition context prior to this show. The selection of images presented in Area A reverses the normative process whereby photographs are first produced for physical presentation and then uploaded to the internet. Instead, a substantial number of Culley’s images have been harvested from the thousands on his blog and presented in a curated gallery installation. Like his photographs, Culley’s latest book of poetry Parkway (2013) completes his Hammertown trilogy, a text-based portrayal of the landscape surrounding the poet’s home, that includes the books The Age of Briggs & Stratton (2008) and Hammertown (2002), all published by Newstar Books.",

Many of these prop paintings were produced and continue to be developed long after the work for which they were originally intended was completed.\n\nGraham—who is well known for his literary and conceptual artworks, cinematic installations and costume dramas, as well as the music he creates as a singer-songwriter—turned seriously to painting in 2003, producing heavy impasto paintings and gestural monochromes that make reference to modernist masters such as Pablo Picasso, Lucio Fontana and Kazimir Malevich. Among the many works in the exhibition is Black Tapestry, a series of black square paintings made on multiple copies of the record cover of Carole King’s 1971 masterpiece, Tapestry. The exhibition also features the largest upside-down drip painting made by the artist to date.\n\nRodney Graham: Props and Other Paintings is the final installment of a trio of exhibitions held from May to November 2014 in Vancouver, including Rodney Graham: Collected Works (May 31 to October 4) at Rennie Collection at Wing Sang and Torqued Chandelier Release and Other Works (June 20 to August 17) at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery at the University of British Columbia.

    "summary": "The Port / Matthew Buckingham: Obscure Moorings is an exhibition in two parts that looks at the points of contact between the maritime worker and the port city and, by extension, the maritime worker's place within the urban economy.\n\nIn Obscure Moorings—Matthew Buckingham’s film installation based on Herman Melville’s short story Daniel Orme—a sailor’s last days are spent in Liverpool, a once vital seaport which, like Vancouver, is being dramatically redefined by social and global economic change. Buckingham writes that without “using words the pictures and sounds juxtapose different archetypal sites from Liverpool’s city-scape, allowing places and their respective ‘pasts’ to resonate with and contradict each other.” The wave of change that impacts inhabitants of most port cities is akin to the drastic change that befalls Daniel Orme as he transitions from sea to land. This wave of change is physically manifested by Buckingham as the platform on which viewers sit when watching his film. An impressive curvilinear wave, the platform fills the Satellite’s largest exhibition space.\n\nAlongside Matthew Buckingham’s installation is The Port, a companion presentation of objects and archival materials related to Vancouver’s own history as a port. Social spaces within our city catering to the moral wellbeing of maritime workers (along with those engaged in gratifying their more venial needs) are represented—from images of the Seamen’s Institute and the Sailors’ Home (which later became a brothel) to the model ship that hung for decades on the wall of the Marine Club. The conflicts between maritime workers and business interests are also explored, as are the ways in which many of the traditional functions of a port are increasingly at odds with the escalating economic value of waterfront property.",

Aspen broke new ground in terms of its editorial concept, design approach and distribution strategy, which continues to be resonant and influential today.\n\nThe magazine featured a diverse and impressive array of contributors, from such key artists, musicians, authors and theorists as Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning, Ian Hamilton Finlay, David Hockney, Jasper Johns, Allan Kaprow, Ed Ruscha, J. G. Ballard, Bill Evans, Philip Glass, the Velvet Underground and Yoko Ono. Known as “the magazine in a box,” Aspen was made up of unbound contents that included texts, flexi-discs, reels of film and other objects. It struck a chord in the 1960s artists’ publishing culture—which included publications by Marcel Duchamp, Seth Siegelaub and members of the Fluxus movement—and embraced the idea of presenting travelling exhibitions in a book (or a box, for that matter) in order to provide alternative spaces and economies for art.\n\nThe exhibition features complete sets of all issues, with a focus on the combined edition of issues five and six from 1967, which was guest-edited by Brian O’Doherty and is referred to as The Conceptual Issue. Contributors to this issue include Marcel Duchamp, Samuel Beckett, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, Hans Richter, Sol LeWitt, Mel Bochner, Naum Gabo, László Moholy-Nagy, Dan Graham, George Kubler, Robert Morris, William S. Burroughs, Roland Barthes, Susan Sontag, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Morton Feldman, Michel Butor, Tony Smith and Merce Cunningham.

The exhibition comes out of the artist’s time at Emily Carr University as the Fall 2014 Audain Distinguished Artist-in-Residence.\n\nZink Yi’s multi-faceted art practice comprises sculpture, film and photography. His investigations, centred on the body, explore concepts of identity and the processes whereby the individual becomes part of the collective through a variety of actions such as music making, dancing or physical labour. Through displays and installations his work allows for a shift in meaning, reconfiguring contexts and angles to imagine a transformation of the body—which acts as a medium and interpreter of form, not just a bearer of cultural form.\n\nIn his film work Horror Vacui, for example, the artist looks at the relationship between Afro-Cuban music and the rituals of the Palo Monte and Yoruba religions. In making his recent video installation The Strangers, Zink Yi spent two months in the southern Andes of his homeland Peru documenting the country’s gold and silver mines. He captures both the workers deep in the mines as well as the harshly compelling terrain in and around the worksites. The photographs that accompany the film depict the scars and markings of this landscape, and Zink Yi’s attention to its forms and textures also speaks of his continuing sculptural practice and his critically acclaimed works such as Architeuthis, a 660-pound depiction of a giant squid.",

The paintings in the exhibition, all made within the past year, speak to the artist’s recent investigations into form, materiality, experimentation and happenstance. Though they engage in discourses around painterly abstraction, Heslin’s works are comprised of fabric, ink and dye—materials that are traditionally associated with crafting and needlework. The artist stitches these two seemingly discordant practices together, and although the resulting paintings speak of gendered use value, Heslin is more focused on the opportunities for experimentation that her choice of materials allow. In contrast to paint being applied to the surface of the canvas, Heslins’ inks and dyes seep into the wet surface of the commonplace fabric. As the artist has described, “the mark-making that appears on the fabric in my work consists of traces of pigment from the process of water drying. The lines from this process influence my formal decisions and potentials, and that is the space where the experimental process and formal abstraction engage and produce outcomes.”",

Images from Events Ashore are also included in the exhibition; for this project, Lê was given permission to photograph military installations throughout the world, from the Arctic to the Antarctic, from 2005 to 2012.\n\n The artist documented everything from sweeping panoramas at sea to military exercises on land and humanitarian efforts in countries such as Haiti.

    "summary": "Like a Rolling Stone is an exhibition about rock and rock. Conflating geology and rock music, it considers the ways in which two seemingly unrelated subjects linked by the same homograph share associations and points of contact that are both concrete and implied. Emerging artists, artists with international reputations and iconic artists are brought together in an exhibition that includes painting, photography, sculpture, video and documentation of performances.\n\nLandscape imagery ranging from the sublime to the apocalyptic is a staple in the song lyrics and visual materials of rock music—consider the album covers of Yes and other classic rock bands, or the Nordic vistas summoned by contemporary Viking Metal bands such as Windir. Speaking in relation to her work The Bolero Project, included in the exhibition, Laura Piasta describes how record covers—something you hold in your hand while listening to the music—depict “either the musician or something that’s supposed to represent the music visually. So you have this connection and a narrative that you produce in your mind, but it's just from one image.” Los Angeles photographer Melanie Schiff also plays with the tropes of rock-band iconography in her work, Whitesnake.\n\nEvoking the spirit of This is Spinal Tap, a mockumentary that plays off the affectations and absurdity of rock, Myfanwy MacLeod has reproduced the enigmatic object of Led Zeppelin’s Presence album—which, in turn, was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the obelisk in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, according to Jimmy Paige. Like the album art version (or the Stonehenge replica of Spinal Tap), MacLeod’s is incongruously small, odd and disconcertingly anti-monumental.\n\nThe lore and semiotics of heavy metal are at play in the work of Vancouver artist and designer Sean Coggins. His work in the exhibition includes a mandala installation that grows out of Black Metal’s rituals and mysticism, as well as a series of drawings related to the subculture’s band logos, which are so obscure and illegible to the uninitiated that they take on other characteristics and potential readings.\n\nBerlin-based Slater Bradley plunges into the mystique of the pop idol in his series Doppelganger Trilogy. In each of the videos Bradley’s doppelganger Benjamin Brock plays the part of three fallen icons: Ian Curtis, Kurt Cobain and Michael Jackson. Shot as low fidelity documentations of performance, Bradley’s fictive versions link to specific times in his own life as much as they do to key moments in pop culture. Along with the video work, the exhibition includes a large painting by Bradley that is part of a series based on Joy Division bootlegs.\n\nThe rock icon is also depicted in German artist Nadja Frank’s work, although this time the homograph’s other meaning is invoked. In her Rock Portrait series, Frank photographs rocks collected from various locations and prints them on the scale normally reserved for celebrity headshots. The humble rock, picked up as a kind of souvenir, is elevated to iconic status. Unlike human idols, however, the rock’s strength isn’t diminished by time or scandal. The exhibition also includes Frank’s photograph of a quarry, which unintentionally resembles a concert stage.\n\nVancouver artists Kevin Romaniuk and Liam Hogan work collaboratively focusing on outsider subcultures, occult rituals, rock and roll lineages and stoner mysticism. Their site-specific work Rock & Roll Henge, created for this presentation, functions as a social space where events will be held throughout the duration of the exhibition.\n\nA performative engagement with landscape is strongly associated with the Land Art and Body Art movements of the 1960s and 70s. Two key artists of this time were Dennis Oppenheim and Ana Mendieta. In his 1970 film Rocked Hand, Oppenheim buries one hand with the other until it becomes fully imperceptible within its surroundings. In Mendieta’s 1974 film Burial Pyramid, the artist’s buried body slowly emerges from under a pile of rocks.",

    "summary": "The title of Neil Young’s 1979 album Rust Never Sleeps speaks to the concept behind this exhibition of work by five artists who employ naturally occurring growth—salt, mould, rust, flowers and lichen spores—as their materials. The resulting works address commodity, use value, causality, chance and instability.\n\nRust is an organic or chemical process of decay. It is also a blight that affects plants. In any form, rust is rarely—if ever—a positive thing. We don’t want rust—it damages and destroys. Yet, despite our best efforts, once rust takes hold and starts to grow there is very little chance of containing it. Conversely, art is a valuable commodity and its value increases over time. We display art with pride and it is to be admired and envied. We ensure it is protected and safeguarded. For these reasons, Ruben Ochoa’s use of rust as a material in his series of rust-on-linen paintings is at once unexpected and even blasphemous, yet also richly hued and striking.\n\nLike Ochoa’s rust works, Arnaud Desjardin’s Mouldy Modern confronts the logic of fine art valuation. Desjardin purchased an edition of Histoire Naturelle, a rare 1926 portfolio of prints by Max Ernst, that was mottled with a purple mould that was eating away at the surface of the paper. Rather than reducing its value, for Desjardin this added a new layer of meaning to the work, referencing both Ernst’s experimental intentions in originally making the prints and also manifesting traces of time and nature. In Mouldy Modern, Desjardin turns the damaged portfolio into a new work that incorporates the decay and embraces the mutability of the object.\n\nIn a similar spirit, Jason de Haan’s Salt Beards grow—both literally and figuratively—from the objects of the past. The affects of time and happenstance are played out on their surfaces and generate symbolic meaning through de Haan's application of mineral growths that develop and extrude from found and borrowed portrait busts. Like Desjardin, de Haan gives new life and reactivates the original objects, imagining “a continued growth and change that is potentially physical (biological/geological) and ideological.”\n\nHolly Schmidt explores the ideologies and economics of floriculture in her work, Pollen Index. For the exhibition Schmidt has created a flower shop in the gallery window that is open during gallery hours and is accessible online. The shop replicates the vendor stalls in the Granville Island Market nearby. Interacting with visitors and passersby, the project will generate discussion about flower cultivation, re-production, the co-evolutionary effects of desire and the complexity of human relations with the natural world.\n\nLycopodium—or, “Witch Powder”—is a highly combustible moss spore. It was once a homeopathic remedy for a variety of ailments and was also used in explosives (the American government once tested it for potential use in chemical warfare). In the hands of Raphael Hefti, the spores are dusted over photo paper and set alight to make psychedelic, multicoloured photograms. In discussing his approach to making art, Hefti has said: “My direction of the process is intended to create something new away from, or in subversion of, the typical outcome. And of course this new process is prone to its own mistakes, to accidents and not 100% under my control.”\n\nInviting destabilizing forces into the making of artwork is key to all five of the artists in the exhibition. Though their materials are precarious, they nevertheless embrace the risk and unpredictability that comes with using growing matter, with its own predetermined objectives, as a medium.\n\nNatasha Myers has been working at the cusp of art, science, and anthropology for decades. She is an associate professor in the Department of Anthropology at York University. Her book Rendering Life Molecular: Models, Modelers, and Excitable Matter (Duke, 2015) is an ethnography of an interdisciplinary group of scientists who make living substance come to matter at the molecular scale. Her current projects span investigations of the arts and sciences of vegetal sensing and sentience, the politics and aesthetics of garden enclosures in a time of climate change, and most recently, she has launched a long-term ethnography experimenting with the arts of ecological attention in High Park’s Oak Savannah.",

    "summary": "For the past four decades, Heap of Birds has made multidisciplinary artworks that confront the oppression of Indigenous peoples and attest to the artist’s profound bond with the landscape of his Cheyenne and Arapaho homeland.\n\nLikening his art to “sharp rocks,” or the arrowheads traditionally used as tools of defence, Heap of Birds has stated that “the survival of our people is based upon our use of expressive forms of modern communication. The insurgent messages within these forms must serve as our present day combative tactics.” This strategy is at play in the two series of text works in the exhibition—Secrets in Life and Death (2012) and Genocide and Democracy (2016)—where Heap of Birds combines seemingly incongruous words into complex statements that are fraught with meaning.\n\nIn a book on Heap of Birds that was recently published by Duke University Press, Bill Anthes writes: “His words grab. They compel repeating and turning over in one’s mind, teasing out the numerous possible meanings, opening new perspectives on unexamined histories, places and ideas. These are words that ask questions, or make us ask them—words that work.” Secrets in Life and Death was originally made for an exhibition in which historical Native American artworks were shown alongside Heap of Birds’ monoprints (for example, a monoprint that reads: “Happy to donate what you took”), thus creating a dialogue around institutional collecting. For Genocide and Democracy, the artist took excerpts from American patriotic songs and combined them with his own texts to produce disconcerting, definitive statements on the politics of inequality. In fact, in many ways Heap of Birds sees this series as a response to the upcoming American election.\n\nThe exhibition also includes four paintings from the artist’s Neuf series, a large, ongoing body of work that he began in the early 1980s. These abstracted landscapes were originally painted outdoors and express a renewed connection to the land. For Heap of Birds, the natural world is a lively and replenishing place: “The land is the beginning and the end... the earth remains after you are gone, sand was here before one’s distant relatives,” or, as Anthes puts it, “Land exceeds human history.”\n\nA selection of Murano glass vases produced for the artist’s 2007 exhibition in Venice are also presented alongside the text works and Neuf paintings in the exhibition. While the patterns in the handblown glass are similar to the abstracted forms of the Neuf paintings, their title, Native Bodies in Remembrance, Most Serene Republics, Venice Biennale, brings them in line with the subject of the text works—for the solid forms in the glass depict the bodies of Buffalo Bill Cody’s “Show Indians” who died on his European show tours.",

    "summary": "The first solo exhibition of Irish artist Sean Lynch in Canada. Lynch is a skilled storyteller with a knack for unearthing little-known or underappreciated stories. While he employs an ethnographic approach to researching the characters and situations that inhabit these stories, his retellings are sympathetic to the eccentricities of his subjects and their social and historical contexts. Whether it is the tale of a pair of nineteenth-century stone carvers, John and James O’Shea, in his work A Blow by Blow Account of Stonecarving in Oxford, or an attempt to trace the path of discarded parts from the defunct DeLorean car factory in DeLorean Progress Report, Lynch fully embraces the allegorical potential of his subjects.\n\nFor the exhibition, Lynch presents a new video installation entitled What Is An Apparatus? This work, produced throughout 2016 in Europe and North America, was completed this fall during Lynch’s tenure as the Audain Distinguished Artist-in-Residence and features locations in Vancouver. While initially appearing as a collection of somewhat ludicrous encounters with nuclear submarines, postmodern architecture, robots, scrapyards or supermarkets, it gradually becomes apparent that Lynch’s stories are generated as the result of living in an increasingly technocratic world. The measures and institutional values that aim to manage and orient human behavior become more evident in each of his eleven tales. Inside the gallery space, an innocuous collection of chairs and tables, scavenged from around the university campus, soon become embroiled in Lynch’s narrative, becoming the subject of a speculative investment opportunity generated by Emily Carr University’s upcoming move to the Great Northern Way Campus.\n\nThe new work will be presented alongside Latoon, a video work from 2006 that focuses on the story of a whitethorn bush in Latoon, County Clare. In 1999, folklorist Eddie Lenihan successfully campaigned to have a multi million-euro roadway redirected in order to save the bush, which he had argued was an important meeting place for fairies. The exhibition also includes the video work Adventure: Capital, which was first presented at the 2015 Venice Biennale. Spanning geography and historic time, its narrative follows “a wandering spirit encountering the hegemonic structures that anchor contemporary life and entwined flows of capital, migration and neoliberal spatiality”*\n\nAlso on exhibition is Campaign to Change the National Monuments Acts, a video installation that investigates the legal status of metal detectors in Ireland. Following national controversy around the finding of the Derrynaflan Hoard, a medieval treasure trove uncovered in the 1980s, the state hastily placed a blanket ban on the public use of all devices used to search for archaeological objects. This legislation effectively destroyed the fledgling Irish metal detectorist community of Ireland. Using the tropes of a promotional video, Campaign to Change the National Monuments Acts advocates for a change in these authoritarian laws, where ideas of nationhood, individual freedom, and the need for new forms of community-led heritage are all explored on a journey again narrated by Lynch’s long-time collaborator Gina Moxley.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the publication of Vancouver Days, a new book by Sean Lynch that includes the artist’s writing on some of the people, objects and ideas influential to his thinking. Swaying between the objective-informative and the anecdotal, topics explored include folklore, public art, newspapers, architectural ornament and literature. With a keen interest in the offbeat and marginal, each text aims to identify strains of thought to resist the technocracy of western thinking, most particularly in the artist’s native Ireland.” Vancouver Days is co-published by the Charles H. Scott Gallery and Publication Studio Vancouver.",

    "summary": "The Charles H. Scott Gallery is proud to present Goodbye Charles, an exhibition that celebrates Charles Hepburn Scott, an artist, educator and our gallery’s namesake, in commemoration of the latest chapter in our history. In the fall of 2017 we will relocate to the new Emily Carr University campus on Great Northern Way in East Vancouver where the Charles H. Scott Gallery will be renamed the Libby Leshgold Gallery. This exhibition offers a glimpse into Scott’s creative practice through the inclusion of his paintings, drawings, sketchbooks and writings. Contemporary artists that have exhibited at the Charles H. Scott Gallery have also been invited to respond to the occasion. A diverse list of artists have contributed portraits of Scott to a bookwork, and two additional projects will be situated within the gallery by London-based artist duo Cullinan Richards and Vancouver artist Ron Tran.\n\nAs a catalyst, organizer and champion of artistic freedom, Scott helped to shape and define the arts in the city of Vancouver. Along with a core of committed artists and patrons, Scott was instrumental in the founding of the BC Arts League, the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts and the Vancouver Art Gallery, laying the foundation for our internationally recognized contemporary art scene. He had an unshakeable belief in the importance and value of the creative arts.\n\nIt was under Scott’s supervision that the students at the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts began mounting their annual Beaux Arts Ball and other costumed amateur theatrics. The first ball occurred in 1929 with a medieval-theme. Scott took an active role in these spectacles and his own interest in staging and costumes was evident in his sketchbooks and working notes from his student days at the Glasgow School of Art. Not only did the annual ball raise the profile of the art school within the local public imagination, these kinds of events also helped to strengthen bonds within the art community itself. Further evidence of this can be seen in the summer sketching camps on Savary Island that the school organized and he led, at which students and artists/teachers would sketch and paint en plein air, engage in critiques of each other’s work and perform in concerts and plays, often creating costumes out of the flotsam and jetsam found on the beach. Images and anecdotal recollections of such trips evidence a relaxed camaraderie within the group of participants.\n\nFor the Goodbye Charles exhibition Cullinan Richards and Ron Tran respond to the Beaux Arts Balls and the spirit of the Savary Island camps. Cullinan Richards have been shown in both group and solo exhibitions at the Charles H. Scott Gallery. Their installations explore painting, drawing, sculpture, theatricality and exhibition-making. Commonplace materials are employed in the production of their work, including plastic, cardboard, house paint and tape—standard materials used by artists in the making of their work rather than as the finished product.\n\nLike Cullinan Richards, Vancouver artist Ron Tran has had both solo and group exhibitions at the Charles H. Scott Gallery. Tran makes work using a wide range of media and much of his work is performative and temporal in nature, with a sense of community and generosity at play. Tran often works collaboratively with other artists in projects that play with and break down the notions of authorship and the rarefied art object",

    "summary": "Never Precious is an exhibition of vernacular Canadian design from the early to mid-twentieth century. The exhibition pivots on the Eaton’s catalogue, which was published by the department store retailer from 1884-1976. The catalogue is an example of a designed publication that relied on systems of illustration and product design to have a major impact on Canadian material and visual culture. Other objects on exhibit include a Canadian Cycle and Motor Co bicycle, a Robbins & Myers Oscillating Fan, dishware from Medicine Hat Potteries, a projector from Bell & Howell, a Reliable Plastics Uke-a-Tune as well as a selection of items such as games and toys, and ephemera such as hotel and travel brochures.\n\nWhile individually many of these everyday objects and ephemeral works may be considered banal and unremarkable, presented together in this exhibition they create an ecology that tells of Canada’s design history—a history that has been inconsistently recorded and discussed. This inconsistency stems from the circumstances around the design and production of goods, mainly that throughout the twentieth century, the majority of Canadian designers were known to have followed or borrowed aesthetic principles from the USA and Europe and their design work was produced anonymously. This has limited the information available to historians as they attempt to define Canadian design.\n\nNever Precious engages with this historical problem of identity within Canadian design and aims to demonstrate the richness, the wide range and prolific scale of Canadian design.",

    "summary": "The Pacific, the inaugural exhibition at the Libby Leshgold Gallery, brings together artists from countries in and around the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe exhibition considers the Pacific Ocean as a shared and connected space. It explores the idea that although the Pacific is an immense body of water there is a strong sense that it is a space of connection between peoples that live beside or are surrounded by it — that it brings people together rather than separates them. In contrast, much of the narrative around the Atlantic Ocean has historically perceived it as a space of distancing and division.\n\nIn thinking about the Pacific Ocean as a shared space we can consider the histories and contemporary concerns as linked while also being specific to each place. The show will include works that address environmental issues such as rising sea levels, nuclear contamination, the impact of industry and the built environment on the ocean. It will also consider human migration and the experiences of migrants. Finally it will touch upon our deep personal and spiritual bonds to the waters of the Pacific.\n\nSome of the work in the exhibition include excerpts from Charles Lim’s Sea State, which was shown at the 56th Venice Biennale at the Singapore Pavilion, Paula Schaafhausen’s Ebbing Tagaloa, an installation made of sand and coconut oil, and Khvay Samnang’s Air, a video made in the Fukushima Prefecture shortly after the nuclear disaster occurred. Isabel and Alfredo Aquilizan will be making a large site-specific installation in the gallery in the weeks leading up to the opening.",

    "summary": "The Libby Leshgold Gallery is pleased to present QULLIQ: In Darkness, Light, a solo exhibition of new work by Maureen Gruben. The qulliq is a traditional oil lamp that was once the heart of the home. It was used to heat, to cook and to bring continuous light during the darkness of the Arctic winter. The new work included in this exhibition explores notions of light and transparency related to the light of the oil lamp as well as the translucence of ice.\n\nGruben forges critical links between threatened Arctic lands and communities, and international environmental and human conditions through disassembling and re-forming polar bear fur, moose hides, seal skins, gathered kelp. In her work, abstraction of form sits in active tension with the acutely ‘real’ presence of her geographically and culturally embedded mediums.\n\nGruben spent much of her childhood sewing with her mother, who was a seamstress, and trapping with her father. She has a tacit knowledge of Arctic land and the rich but increasingly precarious resources it offers. Frequently addressing themes such as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), melting ice, and the rights of indigenous hunters to maintain their way of life, Gruben’s practice is permeated with activism while at the same time allowing generous room for her materials themselves to speak. While referring explicitly inwards to localised acts of hunting, gathering, communal preparation and sharing—and even to individual animals—her work, equally, extends decisively outwards, exploring new visual languages that offer compelling and often urgent global associations.",

The Summer School will expand on READ Books’ mission to create a platform and social space for experimental practices in publication by bringing leading local and international artists and practitioners together to present exhibitions, seminars, and public events.\n\nIt’s difficult to put a painting in the mailbox is a quotation from John Baldessari’s artist book Ingres and Other Parables (1971). The book is comprised of short stories about the art world and our borrowed exhibition title is the punchline-like moral of “The Best Way to do Art,” a parable about an artist experiencing paintings by Cezanne in person for the first time after only having seen them reproduced in books. Although Baldessari’s sentence is from 1971, it touches on key ideas and issues that artists producing publications—be they digital or paper—continue to consider, work or even grapple with such as audience, circulation, and distribution. Lucy Lippard echoes Baldessari’s maxim in her assertion of primary information, that an artist book is an artwork as such (as opposed to a book about an artwork).",

    "summary": "A solo exhibition by Irish artist Dorothy Cross. The exhibition features two works: Stalactite, a single channel video work; and Foxglove, a small bronze sculpture.\n\nCross’s video work depicts the Great Stalactite of Doolin Cave in Country Clare, Ireland.  More than seven metres long and weighing over ten tonnes, the stalactite is an enormous calcite formation made from accumulated drops of water over hundreds of thousands of years. Twisting and folding like sheets of fabric, the stalactite defies gravity, clinging on to the cave ceiling by a mere three square metres of calcite. Below the chandelier-like form stands a boy soprano, his clear voice echoing through the cave as he sings a series of vocal utterations. Both the stalactite and singing attest to the progression of time – from the passing of millennia to the bittersweet temporality of a boy soprano’s voice.\n\nLike Stalactite, Cross’s bronze Foxglove is a contemplation on time and mortality. As a flowering plant, the foxglove blooms for a short period before falling dormant for two years. As a bronze work of art, the foxglove is frozen in time. The foxglove has the ability to both take life and prolong it, as it is not only one of the most poisonous common plants but also the source of digitalin used in life-saving cardiac medications.\n\nThe work in the exhibition speaks to the artist’s interest in exploring the place of human beings within the natural world. Often using materials associated with the sea including pearls and shark skin, she makes objects that blur the boundaries of both territories.",

    "summary": "Designing Death is an exhibition of contemporary funerary architecture and objects. Featuring architects and designers from around the world, the exhibition explores the role of thoughtful and innovative design within the functions and rituals related to the passage from life into death, taking into consideration both the deceased and the bereaved that mourn their passing. The design choices that comprise the projects included in the exhibition are informed by the ways in which they are used, such as how a funeral procession moves through a building, how a body physically breaks down, and how a ritual object is used for memorialization.\n\nOne example is the Capsula Mundi, from the Italian design team Anna Citelli and Raoul Bretzel. An alternative to the traditional casket, the Capsula Mundi is a bio-degradable burial pod out of which grows a tree that is nourished by the body interred within. The Capsula Mundi, and other green burial projects, have the potential to redefine the cemetery, from a space of rigidly conforming rows of stone with concrete tombs above ground and toxic chemicals below, to a naturalized parkland that contributes to the environment through natural growth.\n\nThe award-winning Bushey Cemetery, by UK-based Waugh Thistleton Architects, emphasizes the integration of built forms with the surrounding landscape. For the design team led by Andrew Waugh, \"The process of the Jewish funeral defined the design for the extended site; each point in the processional ceremony was landscaped to provide contemplative settings and views, harnessing the site's established trees as key pivot points.\" The prayer halls are made of timber and rammed earth, materials that are both resilient and sustainable. The buildings are designed with the idea that once the cemetery is full and they are no longer in use, they can largely break down and return to nature.\n\nMourn is a project by Studio Nienke Hoogvliet that was created in collaboration with the Dutch Water Authorities. A sustainable bioplastic (PHA or Poly Hydroxy Alkanoate) made from waste water is mixed with cremation ashes to form an urn like object. The specific form of each urn is based on the soil conditions of specific sites so that local flora and fauna can effectively break down the nutrients and potential toxins contained in the ashes.\n\nA simple cotton burial shroud, such as the one included here by Northwoods Casket Company, has one of the lowest carbon footprints of all burial practices. The shroud, whether used in cremation or for internment in a grave, has been used for millennia by many cultures and religions and is gaining popularity in contemporary natural burial practices.\n\nCremation is standard practice in the Hindu religion, and when tasked with modernizing an existing crematorium in Hyderabad, India, the architectural firm D A Studios looked to the Antyeṣti for their inspiration. Antyeṣti, the final phase of life, consists of five stages related to the mourning and cremation process, and each architectural component of the Mahaprasthanam Crematorium is designed to speak directly to the path through these stages.\n\nThough half a world away and designed for the Christian faith, the Chapel of St Lawrence in Vantaa, Finland, is also based on a symbolic route. Designed by Avanto Architects, this cemetery chapel embraces the concept of a polku, or path from mortality to eternity, from here to the hereafter. The building is a striking combination of white masonry and patinated copper. According to Avanto, \"An important factor in choosing the materials was locality in addition to longevity; and on-site building and an emphasis on craft were distinct features of the whole project. These ways of working ground the building in its surroundings and display the traces of handcraft.\"\n\nUrns can be used to house cremated remains for a finite period of time, before they are spread at sites that are significant to the departed, or kept as vessels that contain the ashes for prolonged periods of time so that loved ones can keep them close. Vessels for both purposes are included in the exhibition. Cree/Metis carver James Michels makes bentwood boxes that can be used for both contemporary funerary purposes as well as traditional ceremonial uses, such as the transportation of repatriated bones. Polish designers Jo Jurga and Martyna Ochojska, working under the name Nurn, make biodegradable vessels that can be used for ceremonial burials at sea or for internment in the ground. They also make striking vessels made of wood, concrete, and copper that function as both urn and sculptural object.\n\nRitual and memorialization are immensely important to the grieving process. Until recently, there was little acknowledgement or accommodation made for grieving parents who have lost pre- and post-term babies. The first of its kind in North America, the Little Spirits Garden in Saanich, BC, designed by Pechet Studio, is a dedicated space for the memorialization of infants. The garden includes small houses that families can decorate and motifs based on the womb and heart. It is a place where families can come together to help each other through the mourning process.",

Since then her work with publishing—straightforward as well as experimental and performative publishing—has become the mainstay of her practice, and is highly influential in the field of artists’ publishing.\n\nThis exhibition focuses on Banner’s Heart of Darkness, published in 2015 by The Vanity Press in collaboration with Four Corners Press. Banner’s remake of Joseph Conrad’s 1899 novella takes the form of a glossy luxury magazine. It began to take shape when she accepted an invitation by the Archive of Modern Conflict to conduct research in the archive. Noting a lack of contemporary images, Banner commissioned Magnum photographer Paolo Pellegrin, who is well known for covering global conflicts, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo where Conrad’s narrator Marlow sets his story, to turn his lens on the financial district of London. These images form the illustrations that accompany the text. Alongside the publication itself, the exhibition includes related work such as Breathing Bag (2016), a small kinetic sculpture made up of a plastic bag printed with a misquote from the novella that reads “Mistah Kurtz—He Not Dead” and the film Phantom (2015) in which a drone Phantom camera attempts to read Heart of Darkness as the down draft from its blades continually blows the magazine out of reach, eventually destroying it. \n\nFurther, the exhibition reflects on earlier works such as The Nam and Trance (1997), including Banner’s verbal remake of Apocalypse Now, which in turn translates Francis Ford Coppola’s redeployment of Conrad’s narrative framework from Heart of Darkness. Other works on display include a selection of Full Stop Inflatables (2018) and Full Stop Bean Bags (2015), which take the form of massive 3D period marks from various fonts. Also featured are the artists’ books Scroll Down and Keep Scrolling (2015), Font Book (2016), and select artworks related to them.",

    "summary": "A solo exhibition by Myfanwy MacLeod entitled The Undesirables, featuring works drawn from her public art endeavours over the past ten years and including both realized and unrealized projects as well as propositional ideas. Studies, casts, and working models created as part of the design and production process, largely overlooked as art works in their own right, are on display in the exhibition as are works that have grown out of her public art projects.\n\nAt the centre of the exhibition is a twelve-foot tall cast for Primrose, a sculpture of a donkey soon to be installed in Toronto. Like MacLeod’s set of iconic public sculptures, The Birds, installed in Vancouver’s Olympic Village, Primrose is the antithesis of the soulless “turd in the plaza” (a phrase coined by architect James Wines). Both of these public sculptures, along with The Lady, a camel installed in North Vancouver, make up a trilogy that alludes to the symbolic language of animals in Western art. At the same time, they reference histories and specifics of the sites where they are permanently located. This blending of art history, popular culture and folklore is a consistent feature of MacLeod’s work whether it is presented in a gallery or a public space. It skillfully walks the line between conceptual consideration and the appealing whimsy.\n\nMyfanwy MacLeod’s work is charming, but at times it also touches on social, political and environmental concerns such as in her work honouring Jane Jacobs, the feminist, author and activist whose ideas about healthy urban environments put her at odds with urban renewal schemes of the nineteen sixties and seventies. Jacobs’ advocacy work and writing around the social constructs of a city continue to influence urban planning and artistic engagement within the urban environment.",

    "summary": "The Libby Leshgold Gallery is pleased to present a solo exhibition of work by Masaomi Yasunaga, a ceramic artist based in Iga-shi, Mie, Japan. The exhibition is comprised of 98 pieces that are interstitial in nature -- existing somewhere between utile vessel and sculptural object, between formation and decomposition.\n\nAlthough referred to as ceramics, Yasunaga’s experimentation has led to a process that has removed clay and replaced it with glaze as the primary material element. In order to counter the fragility of the glaze and maintain their form during production, the objects are buried in trays of sand, soil, or rocks. Following their wood firing, they are disinterred in a process akin to archeological excavation, a reference that is further enhanced by the way they are installed in the exhibition on tomb-like mounds of rough gravel.\n\nThough undeniably connected to the earth, there is something in the work that is also evocative of underwater archeological finds retrieved from a sunken wreck. As with things unearthed from either sea or land, or memories unearthed from hidden places, the work reminds us of the transformational nature of time, bearing both its ravages and beauty. In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Leah Ollman described Yasunaga’s work as “extraordinary objects, tactile things with insistent, engrossing physicality”.",

Produced as part of Wendy’s Subway’s online residency at READ Books and the Libby Leshgold Gallery at Emily Carr University of Art + Design, the archive gathers these publications as an incomplete document of the present, that attests to ongoing histories of struggle for justice, and the current international crisis which informs our collective imagination of radically better futures. The archive aims challenge the conditions that have contributed to this current crisis, considering public health and justice in the broadest sense — including the ongoing global pandemic and its intersection with the crises of capitalism; mass incarceration; police violence; white supremacy; attacks on Black, Indigenous, immigrant, LGTBQIA, and disabled lives; environmental devastation; authoritarianism; housing insecurity and increasing economic precarity; among many other threats to human life and dignity.\n\nIn centering the work of independent publishers, we strive to document how creative networks have produced and disseminated urgent, nuanced, and collective responses that contribute to sociopolitical change on local and international scales. Mapping the intersections between social movements, activist efforts, emergency response, mutual aid, protest, resistance, and artists’ publications provides a framework for a broader consideration of the role of creative and critical publishing practice in facilitating social transformation.\n\nWith this archive we invite you to consider: What new forms can community solidarity and mutual aid take in this time of crisis? How can independent publishing ecosystems support networks of care actively counteracting systems of oppression?",

Qaddah has subverted the precision embedded within the artform and rendered it asymmetrical. In doing so, the pattern is interrupted, such as personal lineage might be through the distancing from one’s origins by generational displacement.\n\nBy creating a work that resembles a large flag, Qaddah reflects on their own fraught relationship to the idea of nationalism that seeks to bridge together citizens through economic and political placements, rather than through cultural perception. Presented in this form, the flag serves as a call to solidarity across the experience of intergenerational loss, while forefronting the value of science and technology in fostering an individual’s relationship to lineage.",

    "summary": "A new exhibition at the Libby Leshgold Gallery — Em̓út | Being Home — showcases contemporary artwork from some of British Columbia’s most accomplished contemporary Indigenous artists. The exhibition is a collaboration between the Libby Leshgold Gallery, the BC Achievement Foundation, and guest curators Ray Hartley and Sheila Hall from the Aboriginal Gathering Collective. The exhibition highlights new work from established and mid-career artists and the intergenerational work of members of the same family. The artwork is combined in the gallery with a series of intimate films from the BC Achievement Foundation about the artists and their practice.\n\nThe art has a rich and vibrant history, existing as an integral part of Indigenous cultures who have lived for thousands of years on the Northwest Coast. This dynamic art form, rich in tradition and continually innovating in response to cultural circumstances, is recognized worldwide for its distinctive character and artistic excellence.\n\n\nContemporary Northwest Coast Indigenous artists are keenly aware of their relationship to their own history. They retain a deep respect for the ancient visual language of their ancestors, and a pre-contact understanding of the art and its importance in their cultures. At the same time they push the boundaries of the art form, referencing and combining traditional and non-traditional ideas with innovative use of materials and motifs. They create art that reinterprets traditional practices, highlights current issues, and addresses historic wrongs.\n\nThe exhibition includes artwork in a variety of mediums including painting, printmaking, wood carving, textiles, basket weaving, and sculpture. It showcases the artists' unique interpretations, technical excellence, and mastery of materials, and explores both traditional art and the social, cultural, and political activism of contemporary Northwest Coast art and design. \n\nIndigenous peoples live in all areas of the Northwest Coast, from small villages to large urban centers. They have survived the devastating impact of colonization and residential schools and are now in the process of a new resurgence, thriving in the places in which they live. This exhibition is part of a process of rewriting the historic narratives of governments and institutions and expressing an Indigenous perspective and an Indigenous truth. It is also an expression of Northwest Coast Indigenous artists understanding of Em̓út — of being home.\n\n This exhibition is dedicated to the memory of Ben Davidson — Tlanang nang kingaas (the one who is known far away) — who passed suddenly last August at the age of 44. Ben was a husband, father of five children, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin, and friend. He was also an exceptionally talented artist transforming wood, metal, paint, and paper into exquisite creations that were traditional, whimsical, and full of life – just like him. He believed in the importance of sharing Haida culture whether it was dancing at a potlatch – he was a member of the Rainbow Creek Dance Group — or creating extraordinary artwork to reflect traditional beliefs and stories. He always had a good story to tell and was incredibly generous, contributing to his community by donating art, sharing his time, or providing mentorship to others. Ben participated in two previous international exhibitions in Hawaii with the Aboriginal Gathering Collective and several of his artworks are in this exhibition.",

    "summary": "Under the heat the banana tree becomes increasingly uncomfortable. Thirsty, it takes more and more energy into its roots and senses a squeeze throughout its torso. But as the banana tree grows, what at first feels like an embrace, morphs into a slow constriction as binds and shackles of copper grip its woody flesh. To its misfortune, the banana tree cannot stop growing. It pleads, it tightens, it pleads, it tightens, until it can take no more and begs you for release.\n\n \nA botanical incantation is cast somewhere in the syncretism between mystic, precolonial and Catholic ritual. A shrine of lush confinement appears, a vestige from decades of violence and destruction, at once humid but sharp, vibrant but dark, as if watching a tropical thunderstorm. Spattered lead and reconstructed shards adorn the vessels that house the spirits in their sweaty splendor. Panes of glass seal secret spells, undisclosed, like that of a clandestine love affair. A vine reaches out its leaf to blow a kiss, a knowing wink to you from behind the window. Choose reverence or torment, you might get a wish.\n\nMaybe the cousin to the banana tree spirit is the one that lies in the 42” flat screen. Is the energy running through the LED any different from the energy running through the vine’s stalk? Old-world spirits remain, while their manifestations take new forms. Advanced technologies generate electronic anting-anting and new cybernetic portals for spirits to reveal themselves. Like finding the holy ghost in a sunset, you never know when you might encounter the divine in the digital, hidden between corrupted images, chain emails and system error codes.\n\n\n(Text by Asia Jong)",

    "summary": "This summer, the Libby Leshgold Gallery is pleased to present Around the Corner, a solo exhibition by Vancouver-based artist Tom Hsu. Through his decade-long, diaristic photographic practice that chronicles queer life, Hsu registers the inseparability between the banal tenderness of gesture and the record-keeping work of intimacy.\n\nAround the Corner spans a wide range of subjects, drawing from Hsu’s many ongoing photographic series. Portraits of friends, family, and strangers intermingle with the sweating bodies of drag balls, unintended still lifs, and domestic interiors. These images sprawl up, down, and around the gallery’s walls in indeterminate groupings, skipping back and forth through time: occasions both celebratory and quiet, floral motifs, and a salt encrusted towel set over a fence are placed alongside overlapping limbs lounging at golden hour, abstract depictions of snow, and Hsu’s ah ma gazing pensively beyond the frame. These proximate scenes expand and contract into moments of longing, solitude, and kinship. The familiar becomes familial.\n\nHsu’s subjects are on the verge of transformation. The formality of the photographic form is breached through his elusive and textured approach to the moments he depicts; each image exceeds its very representation. Encounters and exchanges echo histories of relations while gestures are hinted and repeated, becoming emblems of Hsu’s methodology. The photographs, alongside Hsu’s choreographic sculptures, seek to investigate the multilayered conditions of public and private space as well as the bodies that populate them. Places, spaces, and individuals are drawn together by a desire for affective communities and a commitment to alternative socialities and intimacies. The bounds of subjectivity slip and shift in these photographs, and viewers are invited to see a world in a state of ongoing re-orientation.",

    "summary": "The Libby Leshgold Gallery is pleased to present At Face Value, a retrospective of Vancouver-based artist Cornelia Wyngaarden. Over the past forty years, Wyngaarden has created a complex body of work that considers the relationship between queer, feminist, and decolonial strategies and media, current and historical political events and social conditions, and overlooked individual and collective experiences. At Face Value brings together a selection of video, photography, and installation works that explore themes of gender, sexuality, identity construction, and technology. These works respond to cultural, personal, and historical narratives, interweaving documentary elements and fiction; Wyngaarden’s protagonists disrupt stereotypes, dismantling familiar and deeply embedded power structures while baring the social and political consequences of their actions.\n\nAt Face Value explores the enduring critical complexity of Wyngaarden’s remarkable oeuvre, bringing together a wide range of references: from Greek mythology to Canadian parliamentary history, Western tropes to Film Noir. The exhibition composes a network of unexpected interconnections, tracing the entangled relationship between our most intimate selves and that which we show the world. As A Wife As A Cow (1985) sees interior landscapes set against slow-motion images of cows being roped at a rodeo, interspersed with stories told by an independent female rancher. The proximity of the film’s varying subjects deconstructs everyday expectations about gender, and subsequently the resulting inflections of identity. Selections from Apollo’s Kiss/Matricide: an allegorical landscape (1991), first mounted at The UBC Fine Art Gallery, are shown alongside a revisited version of The Dead Man Was a Woman (1992/2021). Both works consider the body and its vulnerabilities, rights, and representations. Forged Subjectivity (1993), first mounted at Presentation House Gallery, portrays critical contributions to little known movements and histories while reifying the queering of political discourse and activism. Lastly, The Fragility of Origins (1994), first mounted at Front Gallery, references baroque painting and Freudian texts, incisively questioning subjectivity and authorship as it relates to the shifting terrain of personal narrative and historical records.\n \nThroughout her decades-long career as an artist, Wyngaarden has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the Vancouver arts community. Wyngaarden is a radical voice in Canadian art, having played an integral role in the development of numerous important arts institutions in Vancouver including VIVO, Western Front, and Artspeak, particularly in the realm of Media. The title of the exhibition, At Face Value, refers to Wyngaarden’s frank, inclusive, and intersectional approach to living and art making, acknowledging her years of meaningful exchanges within, and beyond, the field of art.\n\nAt Face Value is the culminating exhibition in a series of collaborations between the Libby Leshgold Gallery and curators Phanuel Antwi, Jenn Jackson, and Christian Vistan. The programming series includes the exhibition Around the Corner by artist Tom Hsu, as well as a residency with queer dance collective The Coven (Ralph Escamillan, Kevin Fraser, and Ross Wirtanen). The series will be documented through a forthcoming illustrated publication, to be released by ECU Press.",

    "summary": "“It is the work of ancestors and ancestors-to-be, to support the becoming of what they cannot imagine, but trust will arise.” - Robin Wall Kimmerer, What Kind of Ancestor Do You Want to Be?\n \nWhen considering family and ancestry, we place ourselves in a group, partnership, or as part of a long line. In a society that values individualism, how do we stress the importance of maintaining this interconnectedness? How can we ensure that relationships are built, rather than severed, through the accumulated separations of distance and time? \n\nInheritance is a common thread throughout Related. The objects, stories, skills, and traits we inherit from our ancestors range from physical appearances and second hand items to anecdotes passed down from the generations before us. The artists all look to a variety of materials including archival family photographs, cooking tools, shared activities, and memoirs to recount the ways in which they are linked to their ancestors.\n\nEach of the artists brought together for the exhibition reveal a piece of their identity as it relates to members of their family. Through their work, they find meaningful ways to connect their familial relationships and histories, in the process discovering more about themselves and their origins. From where they’ve been to where they are going, they place these discoveries in relation to both private and public moments, looking inward as well as outward to wider cultural contexts. All five artists live within the imaginary border that delineates so-called “Canada,” each with their own distinct histories and connections to this place, which are reflected in their explorations of family and ancestry.",

    "summary": "The eagle is perched upside-down; it hangs like a bat. Dropped fibres are placed into a vase on an altar, I can't believe I dropped them I don't use this broom to clean. Maybe it's fragile or poorly constructed, maybe it's grown so many feathers It was too heavy to fly and had to push the old ones out. I re-place the eagle back on its lookout hook. Under the altar is a shelf for a deep fried quail egg wrapped in gathered acrylic. Altars all I make is altars. \n\nMemories are things. Things swept off of the ground. Things heard. Things passed down. Things imagined. Things drawn. Things are objects. Objects find their spot; become a poem. Such is the process of translation and transformation in Serisa Fitz James’ tactile practice where memories often turn into ceramic vessels that contain Serisa’s flowing sentences and thoughts. In Serisa’s Altars at Libby Leshgold Gallery’s Glass Corner, these fleeting memories and run-on sentences are given free rein to take shape and find their place. Altars features a deluge of videos collected by the artist along with their animations and poems projected across a parol, a star-shaped lantern hung outside Filipino homes during celebrations and holidays.\n\nHalobaloose, Halo balut\n \nSerisa’s sensibilities are undeniably playful. Whether they’re working with ceramics or telling a story, they approach their materials with elasticity, stretching clay, language and the objects and iconographies they work with to the edges of form and meaning. In approaching these thresholds, strange but familiar sounds, textures and feelings come to the surfaces of Serisa’s works, appearing like the latest linguistic evolution of a word. \n\nThe bone on the ground\nThe bone on the ground has some meat in it still. It's like a dropped ice cream cone.\nOh no! My bone!\n\nIn the poem that inspired some of the animations in this installation, Serisa thinks through the image of a half eaten mango discarded on the ground. The bone is intact too. An entire sequence unravels from this small moment. It traverses the forests and beaches of their mom’s Filipino hometown then jumps back to Canada, where the two of them have developed their own vernacular of words and sounds that combine Tagalog and English with pursed lips and eyebrow wiggles. The significance of this image is in how it pictures the flow of different sensations and ideas in Serisa’s practice, sweet and sandy, nourishment and waste, home and distance.\n\nSkeletal maquettes of several parols are hung all over Serisa’s studio. Undressed without its paper white skin, the parol looks like a drawing of a star, with all of the guiding lines inside the star rendered with bamboo, three dimensionally. These thin bamboo lines form the structure and geometry of the star. Less a singular polygon and more a group of overlapping shapes and intersecting lines, the star’s composition makes window-like facets and portals you can peer into\n\nI often think about the shape of memory, or rather its shapelessness. The spaces between objects, points or the lines. The negative space that shapes it, and therefore is its container. Serisa’s Altars is a repository. The parol is the temporal shape that momentarily holds this pile of memories, stories and colours. They flow across it like a stream or a freestyled verse.\n\nflips Neva flop!\n \nText by Christian Vistan\nExcerpts/poems by Serisa Fitz-James\n\nThe Libby Leshgold Gallery is pleased to present Altars, a new exhibition by Serisa Fitz-James.

The people live in different regions and form distinct cultural groups which cultivate their own artistic styles. They create exquisite art forms with materials gathered from the natural world, art stores, and many other sources.\n\nThe theme of this exhibition is water, and it showcases the artwork of 22 established and emerging Indigenous artists. The exhibition explores the water theme through Northwest Coast formline, storytelling, and the sharing of cultural art making and traditional practice. The artwork includes carving, weaving, jewelry, painting, sculpture, printmaking, video, baskets, clay works, hats, masks, canoe bailers, paddles, and more. The distinct uniqueness of these forms and the use of local natural materials create an exhibition that highlights Indigenous art practices that originate from here.",

    "summary": "Out of Bounds is the fifth installment of the Summer School for Artists' Publishing, presented annually by the Libby Leshgold Gallery and READ Books. This year, we have commissioned several artist-publishers to make new or reanimated works that resist the constraints of conventional dissemination, intellectual property restrictions, state censorship, and economic barriers to reach or form new publics and counterpublics. These works belong to a wider field of publishing that includes unauthorized copies, facsimiles, activist tools and manuals, anarchist cookbooks, anonymous leaflets, banned or suppressed books, street posters, and samizdats.\n\nSome of the publications in this exhibition are available free in the gallery; others are for sale for a nominal price through READ Books.\n\n66B has created a new edition of the 1976 book Instant Furniture: Low-cost, Well-designed, Easy-to-assemble Tables, Chairs, Couches, Beds, Desks, and Storage Systems, a do-it-yourself manual of furniture designs by notable international architects including Carlo Scarpa, Enzo Mari, Garrit T. Reitveld, and Kazuhide Takahama, edited by Peter Stamberg, who also contributed his designs to the compendium. Despite the copyright warnings, the book was widely shared and openly distributed by photocopy amongst artist squat communities in Berlin, Rome, and Amsterdam (and many others) where artists constructed their own living spaces within abandoned buildings during shortages of affordable housing. Long out of print, copies typically sell for hundreds of dollars online; this edition will be sold for the original 1976 cover price, $7.95.\n\naqui Thami has created a poster campaign, a woman was harassed here, which is part of an ongoing street art project. As a young indigenous woman aqui experiences harassment on a near-daily basis, just like the women she knows, cares for and works with. By wheat-pasting posters in vivid pink on city walls, aqui marks the places where she or the women she knows has experienced harassment. The pink posters bear the uncomfortable testimony, “A WOMAN WAS HARASSED HERE.” aqui began this project to engage women in a discourse on harassment, by marking these spaces in vivid pink, highlighting the pervasiveness of harassment against women.\n\nJuan Cisneros Neumann/Tortilla Press presents a newspaper project, La Mancha. Often referred to as the place of birth of Don Quijote, La Mancha stands for any town anywhere. A stain is called mancha in Spanish; something caused by accident or an accumulation of matter in one specific spot over time. In drawing practice one starts a drawing by staining paper (or any surface) to get a sense of direction, similar to the production of a painting. There also exist stained moments in a culture’s identity and history that time is not able to wash away or hide behind gestures.\n\nCrisis Editions, an imprint of Vancouver artist/designer Robin N., has created a new version of CRISIS READER Vol. 1 - Reader on Intersection and Manifestations of Crime and Capital, a reader compilation of texts revolving around the idea of “manifestation and intersection of crime and capital”. The texts document real events and phenomena, each text is augmented with additional research in the form of photos.\n \nPeripheral Review has commissioned a publication by Liz Knox, with a forward by Nathan Crompton. The Anarchist Review is a conceptual response to the infamously banned Anarchist Cookbook (1971). Artist Knox has compiled various online customer reviews of the original book, complemented with an introductory essay on the history of the Cookbook and its place in contemporary society, by activist and scholar Crompton.\n\nHotam Press presents Hong Kong, 2019 - 2021, a collection of the slogans and sayings popularized in the pro-democratic movement in Hong Kong from 2019 to 2021, a period when the city was seized by political conflicts and state repression. All graphics and calligraphy were found on actual protest signs, banners, flags, graffiti, printed matters, postings on social media, and tattoos worn by protesters. Using the form of a newspaper is a tribute to Apple Daily, the last liberal newspaper in Hong Kong, which was forced to close its operation after several personnel (including the owner, executives and editors) were arrested and assets were seized in June 2021.\n \nRachel Lau has made Sorry, We’re Open, an ugly hand-bound compilation of text and images documenting gentrification in Vancouver’s Chinatown.\n\npensamientos en la frontera is an ongoing project compiled by andi and collaboratively riso printed and published with Moniker Press. It consists of a continuously growing bundle of publications and prints that feature many perspectives on displacement and borders. It comes as a new generation of Nicaraguan youth are forced into immigration, to create bridges to connect culture-specific ways forced movement is carried in language, image, and sense of home across cultures. The newest addition is a call to action as more people exercising their right of movement and seeking refuge are met by the violence of border regimes; six months, 111,000 migrants, raided newspapers, swimming lessons for the Rio Grande.",

    "summary": "In Nadya Isabella’s debut solo exhibition A Toast to This Moment, everyday encounters open portals into hidden worlds. Phone screens, ponds, makeup, personal flames, moods, and urban ecology offer gateways into desires floating between fantasy and reality. Gesturing to a vivid elsewhere, Nadya’s paintings emerge from a process of daydreaming and remembering: inflatable tubes create space for peaceful ruminations at the centre of a lake; a cigarette droops between lips while lit behind an umbrella sheltering the wind; fluffy day glow moths gossip, sway, and nibble light; dew drops on spider silks mirror a thousand moons over an ocean.\n\n The picture plane is a diary-—a place to index and recall aspirations, secrets, crushes. Snapshots kept on Nadya’s camera roll of past parties and loved ones are translated into painting. Shahin’s Cake (2022) and Baby’s Cake (2021) are part of an ongoing series documenting cakes shared with friends at celebratory gatherings. Mimicking the size of greeting cards, the intimately scaled paintings show the cakes lit with candles, catching the hold at the top of an inhale before blowing a wish. Within the ritual of celebration, a suspended breath opens a world of possibility. \n\nA recurring character in Nadya’s practice is Toadetta—a glamorous toad with gorgeous lashes and It Girl charisma. She makes a few cameos in the exhibition. In Hors D’oeuvre (2022) a smitten Toadetta interlocks fingers with a lover at an elegant restaurant. Positioning the viewer in the seat of the suitor, the world beyond the table falls away into dreamy pastel hatching. Summer Storm (2022) shows Toadetta ripping down a palm tree-lined highway. With the roof of her convertible down, a streamer of musical phrases from Antonio Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons, “Summer” (1793) escapes from the stereo and winds around the car. Tears collect behind her oval sunglasses as she drives into the sunset. Building on the trope of the ugly toad who is enchanted into beauty, Nadya’s cinematic styling of Toadetta signals an escape from ordinary life. Using source material drawn from movies, popular culture, and lived experiences, the familiarity of Nadya’s references helps orient viewers in the ephemeral worlds she paints. Romance, restlessness, melancholy, and relaxation elevates familiar happenings into baroque vignettes. In A Toast to This Moment, human and non-human protagonists overlap in intricate, cross-species narratives. Anthropomorphism becomes an instrument for empathy, a portal to communicate between two sides of a feeling.\n\n\nText by Kiel Torres.",

Faculty as Resident Artists, which accompanies the exhibition.\n\n\"If faculty are defined and valued by their work of teaching in a classroom or providing service in a boardroom, then these become the foundation for the gallery as a third space. When a visitor entering the gallery finds programming in the space, it is only because of faculty with the interest and capacity to channel their work-time into the time-space of the exhibition. When no faculty are able and willing to activate the space, it stands empty.",

    "summary": "A night swimmer is painted in a sea of ultramarine blues, teals, and magentas. She articulates her limbs in sixteen positions in a painting divided into sixteen frames—her body afloat on/in, on/in, on/in the sea. I think about a figure/ground dichotomy, the swimmer awash in the ground.\n\nAnts, starlings, a swimmer. Yeonoo Park makes paintings that come from observations of bodies in motion. How does a painting capture movement, and with movement, inevitably, time?\n\nThe repetition of a body across a single painting symbolically alludes to motion. It is present as an optical sensation, too, predicated on a viewer’s experience of receding and emerging fields and forms. Each of Park’s painted gestures and layers index her somatic motion at a specific point in time. But it is an ossified motion, a past tense, encapsulated in a painted image that is all-at-once present and does not itself move.\n\n\nIn an animation produced and displayed alongside her paintings, Park turns this all-at-once presence into a linear progression. Using photography, her finished paintings are broken down into a series of frames which are then sequenced together so that a murmuration of starlings scintillates and a body of water ripples. Painted pictures become motion picture.\n\n\nFor Park, painting and animation are mutually reciprocal forms. They function as a looping continuum wherein the paintings become animations, but Park’s first painterly decisions—what shape the support will take, how the image will be mapped onto this support—are predicated on how they will be animated. The paintings and the animations precipitate and choreograph each other.\n\nAn adage: a painting is a window. A framed, pictorial vista into a world apart.\n\nWith a series of cut-out paintings, Park has framed the top of the windows that enclose the exhibition space. Here, another kind of motion and temporality, that of the time of day. Compositions made of washy paint and holes cut into manila paper substrate revel in sunlight and cast slowly moving shadows across the walls. Instead of emphasizing an interior/exterior divide this porous frame opens up to the conditions of the world outside.\n\nIn Park’s praxis it becomes increasingly hard to delimit painting as discrete and autonomous this that is not that. Painting/animation. Painted world/outside world. The diametric slash falters as her paintings unfold, move, sparkle.\n\nText by Mitch Kenworthy\n \n\nThe Libby Leshgold Gallery is pleased to present sweetly, sparkly, a new Glass Corner exhibition by Yeonoo Park. This work will be exhibited in the Southwest corner window of the Libby Leshgold Gallery and is viewable from outside.",

    "summary": "The Libby Leshgold Gallery is pleased to present everything left unsaid, a solo exhibition of work by Jagdeep Raina and the artist’s first in Vancouver. The featured work spans a period of roughly seven years, during which time Raina’s drawing and painting practice has grown to include embroidered textile work and, most recently, stop-motion animation.\n\nBehind Raina’s image-making is an exploration of the archive, and the teasing out of both its possibilities and limitations. The work refuses to see time and memory as fixed concepts and explores questions about community, materiality, and landscape. Raina has worked with personal, civic, and institutional archives and has parsed through photographic, oral, and written histories in order to create a more complex understanding of communities formed as a result of transnational migration—memories, photographs, and retellings from the past are re-animated and histories transformed into narratives unfurling in the present.\n\nMoving through the exhibition, one can see the artist aptly shift between mediums, employing a range of tools and techniques to examine his subjects from every angle. Formed as a result is a living archive that is unfixed and atemporal. In his research based practice, Raina utilizes the archive in order to explore historical memory. His work seeks to identify the residue left behind by the human touch, and its restorative potential.",
